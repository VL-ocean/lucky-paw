This project is a sample of a website for "Lucky Paw" animal shelter. Its goal is to help people find a pet to adopt. Users can find out about the pets online, schedule a visit and get information about the address and opening hours of the shelter. The website can be extended to include a donation section, events section or visitors` reviews.

 ### Design
- ####  Colour Scheme
  - The main color which was used mostly for background, is #F5FAF8 Harp. Its pair as a main text colour, footer and buttons color is #364B44 Mineral Green. For some shadows and accents was used #85B5A4 Acapulco. For more bright accent was used #F98383 Geraldine. The design was planned as soft, nice to watch and simple.

- ####  Typography 
  - Three fonts are used from Google fonts which are: Catamaran, PT Serif and Exo. Main heading`s font is PT Serif italic. Navigation font is Catamaran and text font is Exo. 

- ####  Imagery

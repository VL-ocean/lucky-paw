    - [Gallery page](./README-images/gallery_page_lighthouse.png)
    - [Contact page](./README-images/contact_page_lighthouse.png)
    - [Confirmation page](./README-images/confirmation_page_lighthouse.png)


### Fixed Bugs

- Due to images' size Home page and Gallery page were dropping in Perfomance. To avoid it, all images were restocked in a smaller size and converted to Webp format. They were also optimized. As the result, the pages load much faster.

### Unfixed Bugs
- The form cannot be validated to specify the input characters. Currently you can use digits as your name and surname. The day of the week cannot be validated too, the users can choose Sunday, even tho the shelter is closed at this time. The time input allows to choose 9am for Saturday and 8pm for weekdays, which is also incorrect. This can be fixed using JavaScript.

                    <p>We are a non-profit animal shelter dedicated to providing a safe and loving haven for pets in need. Founded in 2005 by a group of passionate animal lovers, Lucky Paw was born out of a desire to make a difference in the lives of companion animals. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome companion animals, giving them a second chance at a happy and healthy life. From playful kittens to gentle senior dogs, our furry friends are waiting for their forever homes.</p>
